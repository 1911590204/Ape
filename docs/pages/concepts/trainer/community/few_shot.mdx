# FewShotTrainer

## Overview

**FewShotTrainer** is a few-shot optimization method inspired by [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/DSPy) and [adalflow](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow).

If you want to see more details like explanation of the algorithm and difference between implementation and paper, please refer to [here](https://github.com/weavel-ai/Ape/libs/ape-core/ape/core/trainer/community/few_shot/README.md).

## Methods

### `__init__`

It has the same parameters as [`Trainer`](../../trainer.mdx) class, but have some more unique parameters.

**unique parameters:**

- `num_candidates`: Number of candidate few-shot example groups to generate.
- `max_bootstrapped_demos`: Maximum number of bootstrapped examples. (examples with generated internal steps)
- `max_labeled_demos`: Maximum number of labeled examples. (examples selected from `trainset`)
- `success_score`: score threshold to determine if model is successful to solve the task.
