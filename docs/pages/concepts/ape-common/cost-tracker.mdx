# CostTracker

## Overview

The `CostTracker` class is a singleton utility for tracking costs across different categories in an application. It provides methods to add costs, retrieve total cost, get a breakdown of costs by category, and reset the tracker. The class also supports context-based cost tracking.

## Methods

### add_cost

Adds a cost to a specific category.

**Parameters:**

- `cost` (float): The cost to add.
- `label` (str): The category label for the cost.

### get_context_cost

Returns the cost for the current context.

**Returns:**
Dict[str, float]: A dictionary of costs by category for the current context.

### get_total_cost

Returns the total accumulated cost.

**Returns:**
float: The total cost.

### get_cost_breakdown

Returns the breakdown of costs by category.

**Returns:**
Dict[str, float]: A dictionary of costs by category.

### reset

Resets the cost tracker to its initial state.

### set_context

Sets the context for cost tracking.

**Parameters:**

- `context_uuid` (str): The UUID for the context.

## Usage

The `CostTracker` is used internally by `Prompt` to track costs. If you are using a custom subclass of `Generate`, you can use the `CostTracker` to track costs by calling `CostTracker.add_cost` in your `generate` method.

```python
from ape.common.cost_tracker import CostTracker

cost_tracker = CostTracker()
cost_tracker.add_cost(1.0, "embedding")
cost_tracker.add_cost(1.0, "embedding")
cost_tracker.add_cost(1.0, "embedding")
cost_tracker.add_cost(1.0, "embedding")
```
