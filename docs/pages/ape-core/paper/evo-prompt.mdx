# EvoPrompt

## Methods

### `__init__`

It shares the same parameters as the [`Trainer`](../trainer.mdx) class, with some additional unique parameters.

**unique parameters:**

- `evolution_method`: Evolution method to use. `para`, `ga`, `de` are supported.
  - `para`: Paraphrasing
  - `ga`: Genetic Algorithms
  - `de`: Differential Evolution
- `popsize`: Population size.
- `epoch`: Number of generations.
- `parent_selection_mode`: Parent selection mode. `random`, `wheel`, `tour` are supported. only used when `evolution_method` is `ga`.
  - `random`: Random selection
  - `wheel`: Wheel selection, where the probability of selection is proportional to the fitness.
  - `tour`: Tournament selection
- `child_selection_mode`: Child selection mode. `child`, `topk` are supported.
  - `child`: always update the generation with the next generation children.
  - `topk`: Top-k selection. Select the top `k` prompts based on the fitness within parent and children generations.
